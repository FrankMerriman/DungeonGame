However, you cannot&#10;  push a boulder if there is something else blocking it on the other side.&#10;&#10;- Boulders can be teleported using portals and be pushed in the direction of &#10;  you entering the portal like normal. However, you will not teleport if the &#10;  boulder cannot be pushed in the direction where it would collide with another&#10;  object.&#10;&#10;- Boulders can activate floor switches when a boulder is on top of one.&#10;&#10;Portals&#10;- Portals comes in pairs and will teleport you to the other paired up portal.&#10;  Enemies can teleport too and so can boulders.&#10;&#10;Key&#10;- A key will only open a certain door. If you pick one up, try it on different doors&#10;to find the correct door it will open. &#10;- Keys can be picked up by moving over them only if you do not have a key in &#10; your inventory. This means you can only hold one key at a time.&#10;&#10;Door&#10;- Find the unique key that opens the door to open the way. Be careful though,&#10;  once opened, enemies can also go through the door. There is only one correct&#10;  key to open each door.&#10;&#10;Wall&#10;- A wall blocks all movement and is impassable unless an item allows you to do so.&#10;&#10;How to win&#10;- Complete the goals to win.&#10;- Remember that OR means complete either while AND means complete both.&#10;- Reaching the exit must be completed last to win the level. Additionally, reaching&#10;  exit will not count as the goal being completed.&#10;&#10;Hunters&#10;- They will try chase you down to best of their ability (even if it doesn't amount to&#10;much).&#10;- They are persistent but can be fended off with a sword. &#10;- If they reach you and you do not have a sword or an invicibility potion in effect, &#10;  you will lose.&#10;- They cannot push boulders like you do, however. They also cannot pick up items.&#10;&#10;&#10;Different types of goals&#10;Kill all enemies&#10;- Kill all enemies in the level using whatever tools you can scavenge.&#10;&#10;Activate all floor switches&#10;- Trigger all floor switches by having a boulder on top of each switch.&#10;&#10;Reach exit&#10;- Move over the exit. This goal will not be checked off if you reach the goal before&#10;  completing other goals. Thus, this exit should be completed last.&#10;&#10;Collect treasure&#10;- Collect the required amount of treasure to complete this goal.&#10;&#10;Note that you can have mutliple goals. For example: kill all enemies AND activate&#10;all floor switches means you must complete both to win the level.&#10;Kill all enemies OR activate all switches means you can complete either one &#10;(or both, if you're really up for it) to win the level.&#10;">
